## Installing gcdt

This chapter covers the gcdt installation. gcdt's behaviour can be customized using plugins. The gcdt plugin mechanism relies on standard Python package mechanisms. In order to get a good experience and get the most out of gcdt you need to know a few things about Python packaging.
 
This chapter aims to provide you with all the information you need to know on this topic. We also have a screencast in the making related to this topic.

### gcdt package structure

The following diagram gives an overview on the gcdt packages. Please note how we grouped the gcdt packages in the following categories: 

* gcdt - the gcdt core (livecycle mechanism, gcdt tools)
* gcdt plugins - packages to customize how you use gcdt
* gcdt generators and tools - scaffolding and tools to make your work even more efficient

At glomex we have very few (currently one) gcdt packages we do not want to open-source. The glomex-config-reader has very opinionated defaults on how we use gcdt on our AWS infrastructure that is very specific and optimized for our media usecase. 


### Maintaining dependencies for your project

It is a very common practice not to install Python packages by hand. Instead dependencies and version are managed in a documented and repeatable way. Basically you add the names and versions of your packages to a text file. Most projects also group their dependencies into `direct` dependencies of the service or application and packages they need to develop, build, test and document.

The grouping is not enforced by packaging but to have a std. within an organization is beneficial especially if your want to reuse CI/CD tools.

A little opinionated but pretty common:

* `requirements.txt` tools and packages your service directly depends on
* `requirements_dev.txt` tools and packages you need to develop and test your service
* `requirements_docs.txt` tools you need to write and build your documentation

TODO: document version schema

* add gcdt to your requirements_dev.txt
* add the plugins you use to requirements_dev.txt


### Installation

#### Setup virtualenv

Using virtualenv is a little bit evolved so some people do not like to use it. There is three things you need to do.

* create a virtualenv ('$ virtualenv venv')
* install the packages you want to use (see below)
* a virtualenv works basically like every other technical device, you need to switch it on before you can use it ('$ source ./venv/bin/activate')


TODO add private repo deps

All gcdt packages live in a private PyPi repository. See [reposerver](http://reposerver-prod-eu-west-1.infra.glomex.cloud/pypi/) for instructions.


#### Install your dependencies

``` bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_dev.txt
```

If you have additional docs - dependencies for your project you need to install them, too:

``` bash
$ pip install -r requirements_docs.txt
```


#### Activate a virtualenv before use

Again make sure you activate a virtualenv before you can use it:

``` bash
$ source ./venv/bin/activate
```


#### Deactivate a virtualenv

I do not throw away my lawn mower once I am done but with my terminals I do that. But you can deactivate a virtualenv:

``` bash
$ deactivate
```


### Use the gcdt installer

The gcdt installer is deprecated and not recommended for use any more. Please consider to use virtualenv and pip tools to get the most out of gcdt.
